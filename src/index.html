Every dish we create is made fresh on-site, with ingredients sourced or harvested on the same day. We believe in slow cooking and meal-savoring - because good things take time.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about__acticle-text">Now that times have changed, we must adapt. With our new Cook-It-Yourself (CIY) Meal Kits, we bring the Kitchen Comfort experience straight to your doorstep. Inside, you'll find everything you need to recreate our beloved home-style meals: Easy to follow illustrated recipes, prepared ingredients, and even a QR code for real-time cooking videos to help you unleash your inner chef.</p>
                                <p class="about__acticle-text">imes have changed, but our philosophy has not. We believe in the life-changing comfort of a good meal - and now you can cook it yourself!</p>
